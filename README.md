A pure Lisp implementation for reading MPEG-4 audio and MPEG-3 audio tags and audio information.

** Mostly complete.  Your mileage may vary. Most definitely, NOT portable.  Heavily dependent on Clozure CCL. **

Note: There a lot of good (some great) audio file resources out there.  Here are a few of them:

* [l-smash](http://code.google.com/p/l-smash/)
* [taglib](http://taglib.github.io/)
* [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu)
* [The MP4 Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=0130616214) I actually didn't order this until well into writing this code.   What a maroon.
